        Trump suddenly sounds a lot like Jeb Bush and
        Marco Rubio on immigration
    </h3>
    <p id="firstpara">
        If it sticks, his shift away from a pledge to deport 11 million

        repeatedly attacked primary rivals as weak and spineless on immigration.

        A new class of galaxy has been discovered, and
        itâ€™s almost all dark matter
    </h3>
    <p class="para-class">
        According to one of the astronomers who found it, Dragonfly 44 is as big
        as the Milky Way, and its existence exposes how little scientists know
        about how galaxy formation works.
