        There is a bright new JQuery world out there

        Getting started with jQuery can be easy or challenging, depending on your experience
        with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and programming concepts in general.
    </p>
    <p>
        One important thing to know is that jQuery is just a JavaScript library. All the power of jQuery
        is accessed via JavaScript, so having a strong grasp of JavaScript is essential for understanding,
        structuring, and debugging your code. While working with jQuery regularly can, over time, improve your
        proficiency with JavaScript, it can be hard to get started writing jQuery without a working knowledge
        of JavaScript's built-in constructs and syntax.
